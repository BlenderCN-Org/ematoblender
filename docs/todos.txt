This is a list of TODOs - ideas for future work on the software.
It is divided into fixes/additions, and ideas for new features.
This list is ongoing.
Last updated 19 Feb 2016.

FIXES:
coord_transforms.py: Add checks to make sure the data includes 3 axes worth, handle rotation as well.
revise the head-moving camera control for more intuitive control, and for a non-jerky starting position/transition
find a way to make the webcam-livestreaming work in Windows
If present, get the video filepath through the XML, not as a hard-coded reference
In bge_menus_overlays, check that these textures are indeed initialising correctly.

On closing the game/restarting the file improve the communication to the gameserver (it should clear the queues/counts etc)

In the movement of the coils, rotation values are not currently included in the transformations. This is fine for the current IK, but ideally should be included.

Work on the rotation values for Carstens POS files (phi, theta)

Review what happens when streaming file is switched. Changes were made in this area, but do they capture every case?
Eg should the setting of the file change a value in the pps file?

Look at streaming ALL the possible information from the WAVE API, not just the location values.

#TODO
Set TCP_NODELAY on both the client and server side of the RTSERVER, as this may bring speed improvements

FEATURES:
Gameserver to get a GUI, this should encompass some of the CL argument issues, eg choosing output directories.

Improve the way XML is received and used from the WAVE (eg show stats?) and generate better XML from staticserver.

Work to move vertices dymanically in Game Engine.

More stats and controls in Game engine - dynamically add new views/flip axes?

Ghost tongue from recording in game engine on top of live to show template?
Touching targets and changing colors in GE?
